== OPC Server simulator (from Matrikon)
Note that many of these sample scripts require the Matrikon OPC Server simulator (a free product) to be installed. Furthermore, the tests require that the simulator is configured to provide a specific OPC address space - i.e. the tests are hardcoded to this address space.

After installing the Matrikon OPC Server simulator, start it up using  the config file (in this directory).
