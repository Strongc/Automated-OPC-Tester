To build all the modules, run command
'mvn clean install'
from this directory

To build an executable, run command
'mvn assembly:single'
from directory 'gui'
the output of the maven target prints out where the executable jar file goes.

To run the executable jar file, locate the output (see comment above) and double click it.
